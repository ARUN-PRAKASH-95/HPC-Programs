The given mandelbrot set program is optimised by breaking the for loop which runs 100000 times when the absolute value exceeds the threshold,
because it stops the loop from doing unwanted iterarions.

Time consumed by the program before and after optimising

Before Optimising -  8.44 seconds
After Optimising -  1.08 seconds
